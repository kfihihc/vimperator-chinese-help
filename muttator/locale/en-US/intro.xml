All mail clients suck. Mutt just sucks less. This one just sucks less than
mutt.
</html:p>

<h1 tag="intro">Introduction</h1>

<link topic="http://vimperator.org/muttator">&liberator.appname;</link> is a free add-on for
&liberator.host;, which makes it look and behave like the <link topic="http://www.vim.org">Vim</link>
text editor. It has similar key bindings, and you could call it a modal mail
client, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in.
For example, it has a special Message mode, where key bindings behave differently
from the normal mode.
Also most functionality is available as commands,
typing <ex>:back</ex> will go back within the current page history, just like
hitting the back button in the toolbar.

<p>
    However, &liberator.appname; does not try to be a 100% Vim clone, it rather brings Vim's
    ideas to the 21st century. This means making use of new graphical capabilities
    but also of faster computers. Furthermore, great care is taken into making
    its command line interface more consistent and easier to use, while still
    being a powerful extension for advanced users.
</p>
        
<p>
    But &liberator.appname; is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a
    complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can
    enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you
    want to extend &liberator.appname;, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript
    file in its plugin directory.

<h2 tag="overview">Help topics</h2>

<p>
    &liberator.appname; is in an early development stage. There's not too much
    documentation available yet. However, the <link
        topic="tutorial">Tutorial</link> should provide some basic information
    to help you get up and running for now.
</p> 

<p> Please also note that navigation in this help screen is quite limited yet -
    <em>using the links within the help system will not always work</em> as
    expected, so you have to manually navigate using the <ex>:help subject</ex>
    command. So to go on with the tutorial now, please type:
</p>

<code><ex>:help tutorial<key name="CR"/></ex></code>
