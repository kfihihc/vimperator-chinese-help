Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

This is just a quick list of general ideas, which shouldn't be forgotten.
Many other ideas are listed in the wiki and probably these things should
be transfered there as well, for now it just quicker to add/change
things in this list.

BUGS:
- add window resize support to hints
- searching backwards incrementally does not work i.e. with 'incsearch' set
- insert abbreviations broken on <space>
- :sidebar improvements (:sidebar! Downloads while downloads is open should refocus the sidebar)
- ;s saves the page rather than the image
- RC file is sourced once per window
- :undo seems to be effected by the tabstrip state

(the new XML help system bugs):
- markup/links breakage:
  - except for Ex commands and alphabetic mappings (like m), most elements seem
    to link correctly *only* inside a single page (when added after '#' to the
    URI, i.e. liberator://help/foo#bar, but not as liberator://help-tag/bar, which
    is by far the most common unless using all.xml (which is not very usable
    because of the long loading time))
  - the <t> tag does not linkify at all
  - nested tags don't work (e.g. <ex>:set <a>option</a>!</ex>) and often break
    the markup (hide content)
- util.generateHelp() is not there
- the help system seems to take quite some time to set up, so when you have
  some help file opened and saved in a session, you get "File not found"
  initially at start up and have to reload the page


FEATURES:
8 Incremental searches should retreat to their starting position on <Backspace>
8 Replace config.name tests in liberator with more specific feature
  tests or overridable APIs where at all feasible.
8 MAYBE change the extension ID to vimperator@vimperator.org rather than
  vimperator@mozdev.org
8 use the storage module for autocommands
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 all search commands should start searching from the top of the visible viewport
8 :bmark -keyword wikpedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s 
  should overwrite existing keywords. This allows saving of quick searches in the RC file.
8 <C-o>/<C-i> should work as in vim (i.e., save page positions as well as
  locations in the history list).
7 [d could go to the last domain in the history stack. So if I browse from
  google to another page and click 10 links there, [d would take me back to the google page
  opera's fast forward does something like this
7 make an option to disable session saving by default when you close Firefox
7 The output of the pageinfo-command should contain the security-information of ssl-encrypted sites
7 Add :every command
6 check/correct spellings in insert mode with some mappings
6 jump to the next heading with ]h, next image ]i, previous textbox [t and so on
6 :grep support (needs location list)
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 Use ctrl-w+j/k/w to switch between sidebar, content, preview window
6 ;?<hint> should show more information
5 when looking at a zoomed out image (because it's large), zi should zoom in
  maybe with this? : http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/content/html/document/public/nsIImageDocument.idl
5 make a command to search within google search results
  (http://gadelkareem.com/2007/01/28/using-google-ajax-api-as-an-array/)
  maybe impossible, needs a per-site key from google
4 } { should jump to the next paragraph of the page
4 use ctrl-n/p in insert mode for word completion
