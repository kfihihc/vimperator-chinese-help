First there was a Navigator, then there was an Explorer.
Later it was time for a Konqueror. Now it's time for an Imperator, the
VIMperator :)
</html:p>

<h1 tag="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>
<link topic="http://vimperator.org">&liberator.appname;</link> is a
<link topic="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</link>
browser extension with strong inspiration from the Vim text editor,
with a mind towards faster and more efficient browsing. It has similar key
bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ
according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode,
where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most
functionality is available as commands, typing <ex>:back</ex> will go back
within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the
toolbar.
</p>

<p>
    However, &liberator.appname; does not try to be a 100% Vim clone, it rather brings Vim's
    ideas to the 21st century. This means making use of new graphical capabilities
    but also of faster computers. Furthermore, great care is taken into making
    its command line interface more consistent and easier to use, while still
    being a powerful extension for advanced users.
</p>
        
<p>
    But &liberator.appname; is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a
    complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can
    enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you
    want to extend &liberator.appname;, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript
    file in its plugin directory.
